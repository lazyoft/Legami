**Legami: a binding library for Android**

Legami is an Android library for creating bindings among two distinct object paths. 
Simply put, a binding allows a property of an object to *react* to a change in another property of another object.
The system is currently in development, and will include a parser for textual binding expressions, to be used in Android layouts.
